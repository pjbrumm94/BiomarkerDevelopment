# Digital Biomarkers for Psychiatric Disorders

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Python-based program to identify digital biomarkers for psychiatric disorders, improving diagnostic accuracy. The system will leverage biomedical data, machine learning models, and statistical methods to analyze patterns in patient data and predict clinical outcomes.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling and cleaning raw biomedical and behavioral data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting relevant digital biomarkers from datasets.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Training and validating predictive models.
- **Risk Stratification**: Identifying high-risk patients based on digital biomarker analysis.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Enabling live data input and predictions.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/digital-biomarkers.git
cd digital-biomarkers

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Prepare Data**: Ensure the dataset is in the expected format (CSV, JSON, or database).
2. **Run Preprocessing**: Execute the preprocessing script to clean and format data.
3. **Train Model**: Train the machine learning model using available labeled data.
4. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict psychiatric disorder likelihoods.

```sh
python main.py --train  # To train the model
python main.py --predict --input data/sample_input.json  # To make predictions
```
